	<h2>Save money with price alerts!</h2>
	<p>Use pphelper(Price Protect Helper) to track prices of things you're thinking about buying, and save money even after you buy.</p> 
	<p>There are lots of stores out there that offer price protection policies -- when the price drops on an item you've purchased, they'll refund you the difference. But there's a catch... it's up to you to watch prices.</p> 
	<p>pphelper makes it simple to watch prices, keep track of your purchases, and get rebates off price drops. </p>
